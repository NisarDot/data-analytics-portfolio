1. Exploratory Data Analysis – Bank Marketing Dataset
Summary: Performed detailed EDA on a bank marketing dataset to identify patterns in customer response. Tasks included cleaning data, splitting combined fields, handling outliers, and analyzing categorical and numerical variables. The goal was to uncover useful insights for future campaign targeting.

Key Work:
Cleaned and prepared raw data
Treated outliers and missing values
Created new features from compound columns
Performed univariate and bivariate analysis

2. Regression Modeling – Advertising & Housing Data
Summary: Built regression models to predict sales (using advertising spend) and housing prices (using multiple features). Applied end-to-end regression pipeline including feature scaling, dummy variables, model training, and multicollinearity checks.

Key Work:
Simple linear regression with statsmodels
Multiple regression with feature engineering
Used VIF and p-values for variable selection
Interpreted model fit using R² and residual plots

3. Logistic Regression – Telecom Churn Prediction
Summary: Developed a logistic regression model to predict customer churn. Applied RFE for feature selection, checked multicollinearity using VIF, and evaluated performance with classification metrics.

Key Work:
Built logistic model using statsmodels and sklearn
Used RFE to choose top predictors
Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
Tuned probability cutoff for business relevance
